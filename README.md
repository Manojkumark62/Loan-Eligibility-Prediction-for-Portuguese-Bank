# Data Analysis

**Project Overview:** # Data Analysis

## About

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation of a machine learning project. The notebook explores the dataset, performs preprocessing, builds predictive models, evaluates performance, and visualizes results.

## Dataset

The notebook references the following dataset file(s):

- `bank-additional-full.csv`

## Preprocessing & Modeling

The notebook performs typical preprocessing steps (e.g., missing value handling, encoding, scaling) and trains one or more machine learning models.


**Models used (detected in notebook):**

- DecisionTreeClassifier
- LogisticRegression
- RandomForestClassifier
- XGBClassifier

## Requirements

Key Python libraries used in the notebook (inferred):

- `imblearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `xgboost`


## Evaluation

Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report) are expected in the notebook. No explicit output was captured automatically.


## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the dataset(s) referenced by the notebook in the repository root or update paths.
3. Create a virtual environment and install packages.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab and open the notebook file:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Portugese Bankk.ipynb"
```

Run the cells sequentially. If the notebook includes model training, be aware it may take time depending on dataset size and model complexity.
